# PolySign — Progress Log

Running log of completed phases. Claude Code updates this at the end of every phase session. Read top-to-bottom at the start of every new session to reconstruct state.

Format per phase:

```
## Phase N — <name>
Status: complete | in-progress | blocked
Date: YYYY-MM-DD

### What was built
- bullet list of components, classes, endpoints, tables, etc.

### Files touched
- path/to/file1
- path/to/file2

### Verification
- what command was run
- what the expected result was
- what the actual result was

### Deviations from spec
- any place the implementation differs from spec.md, and why
- any ambiguities that were resolved and how

### Notes for next phase
- anything the next session needs to know
- known rough edges to clean up later
```

Status: complete
Date: (fill in)

### What was built
- spec.md (build specification)
- CONVENTIONS.md (cross-phase rules)
- PROGRESS.md (this file)

### Files touched
- spec.md
- CONVENTIONS.md
- PROGRESS.md

### Verification
- `ls` shows all three files present
- `git log` shows initial commit

### Deviations from spec
- none

### Notes for next phase
- Phase 1 starts from an empty Maven project. No Java code exists yet.
- LocalStack must be pinned to `localstack/localstack:3.8` — do not use `:latest`.
